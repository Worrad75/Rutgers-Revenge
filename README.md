# README

Welcome to the Structurally Unique Parameter Engenderment Resource generator, or SUPER! (I tried, ok?)

Today, we'll be building out a relationship between **Superheros** and **Villains**. As avid comic readers, we know that Superheros have many Villains through **Arcs**, but typically Villains have commitment issues and tend to focus on one hero to defeat at a time: in a sense, the Villian belongs to the Superhero.

A Superhero's fields are:
name (string)
description (string)
cape (boolean)

A Villians fields are:
name (string)
description (string)
evil_rating (int, scale of 1-10)
hero_id (int)


The following has been provided for you:

ABSOLUTELY JACK SHIT HAHAHA GOOD LUCK NERD

Just Joshin' ya! You have a `seeds.rb` file that should work once you `db:migrate`, and some basic model structure. The `routes.rb` has been given, but you should tune it up a bit. You should build out the controllers and views for each primary table, specifically the functions:

index
--> Display all instances. You can click on an instance to be taken to an individual show page.
new
--> Render a form to instantiate and persist a new object of the relevant Class
show
--> Display the fields of the instance. BONUS: add a link to the edit page for the given instance
create
--> put the new instance into the database
edit
--> Render a form to edit and persist a preexisting object of the relevant Class.
update
--> put the updated instance into the database

Then, try adding in validation fields for CREATE and UPDATE. Don't forget to display them!
